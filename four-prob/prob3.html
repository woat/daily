  //Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

function first100() {
  let fib = [0, 1],
    prev = 0,
    next = 1;
  for (var i = 0; i < 99; i++) {
    fib.push(prev + next);
    let a = prev;
    prev = next;
    next = a + next;
  }
  return fib;
}

console.log(first100())
